```bash
flutter install
# or manually install the APK from build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/
```

### **2. First Launch**
- App will show **Login Screen** (this is correct behavior)
- Database will be automatically created with default users
- No welcome screen needed - login directly

### **3. Test Each User Type**
1. **Login as Super Admin** (`superadmin` / `admin123`)
   - Should see Admin Dashboard with all management options
   - Test Server Settings, User Management, Course Registration

2. **Login as Admin** (`admin` / `admin123`)
   - Should see Admin Dashboard
   - Test Faculty Management, Department Management

3. **Login as Lecturer** (`lecturer` / `lecturer123`)
   - Should see Lecturer Dashboard
   - Test Course Management, File Upload

4. **Login as Student** (`student` / `student123`)
   - Should see Student Dashboard
   - Should only see enrolled courses (initially none)

### **4. Test Core Features**
- **User Management**: Create new users with different roles
- **Course Management**: Create courses and assign to departments
- **Course Registration**: Enroll students in courses
- **File Sharing**: Upload and download files
- **Server Settings**: Configure PC server connection

## ðŸ”§ **If Login Still Fails**

### **Reset Database** (Nuclear Option)
```bash
# Run the reset script
reset_database.bat

# Or manually:
flutter clean
adb shell pm clear com.example.velocityver
flutter build apk --debug
flutter install
```

### **Check Database Creation**
The app should automatically:
1. Create SQLite database on first run
2. Insert 4 default users with hashed passwords
3. Create default academic structure (faculties, departments, etc.)

### **Debug Login Issues**
If credentials still don't work:
1. Check app logs for database errors
2. Verify database file is created
3. Check if password hashing is working correctly

## ðŸ“± **Expected App Flow**

```
App Launch
    â†“
Login Screen (shows immediately)
    â†“
Enter Credentials
    â†“
Dashboard (based on user role)
    â†“
Access Features (based on permissions)
```

## ðŸŽ‰ **Success Indicators**

You'll know it's working when:
- âœ… Login screen appears on app launch
- âœ… Default credentials work for all 4 users
- âœ… Each user sees appropriate dashboard
- âœ… Role-based features are accessible
- âœ… Database is populated with default data

The app is now ready for multi-device testing with your PC server! ðŸš€
